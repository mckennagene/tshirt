# tshirt

An interactive puzzle and tutorial based on the aperiodic monotile resembling a hat or t-shirt. 

In 2021, an amateur mathematician (self-described hobbyist), David Smith, of East Yorkshire, England, discovered The Einstein. Here Einstein means "one stone" or one tile (not Albert). Together with David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss they proved that this one shape could tile an infinite plane, aperiodically. This one shape, (including it's reflection) was the first time aperiodic tiling was done with only a single shape. It was an astounding discovery and proof.

It also makes for an incredibly hard jigsaw puzzle. Trying to tile even a small area with this shape is very hard if you don't know what your doing. 

This interactive project gives you a hexagonal canvas on which to place, rotate, flip, copy, paste, drag t-shirt (or hat) shaped tiles around.  It also gives a series of lessons on how the tiling can be performed. Even though there is no pattern to the t-shirts, there is a pattern to a set of 4 geometric metatiles that can be overlaid on top of it. It's a beautiful dive into recursive substitional geometry. 

All self-contained html and javascript. Open up the file 'welcome.html' and you are good to go.
